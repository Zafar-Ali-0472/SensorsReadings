# SensorsReadings

## Description
SensorReadings is an Android application that implements various sensors (accelerometer, light, proximity, gyroscope, and pressure sensors) to display their readings in real-time. The app uses the SensorManager class to access the sensors and updates the UI with the current readings.

## Features

- Accelerometer Sensor: Monitors and displays acceleration in the X, Y, and Z axes.
- Light Sensor: Monitors and displays the current ambient light level.
- Proximity Sensor: Monitors and displays the distance to the nearest object.
- Gyroscope Sensor: Monitors and displays the rate of rotation around the device's axes.
- Pressure Sensor: Monitors and displays the current atmospheric pressure.
